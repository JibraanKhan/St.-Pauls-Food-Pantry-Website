          In addressing the food services of our community last year we opened a
          Food Pantry. We initially relied solely on the generosity of our
          parishioners and other food donations from friends and family of St.
          Paulâ€™s. We offer food services for anyone requesting our services
          regardless of their ethnicity or religious affiliation. Our Parish is
          located in the South Bronx, one of the poorest areas of the City.

        <p>
          We serve an average of 100 clients per month with two bags for each
          family. For a six-month period, we serve about 600 clients, sometimes
          more with the warmer months approaching. Our grocery bags contain a
          balanced meal of non-perishable food items. More specifically, we
          provide a protein item (meat, fish or chicken), lentils, vegetables,
          pasta, fruit, cereal and milk.

        <p>
          Twice a month we have Food Pantry events. On the third Saturday of
          each month, we pack the grocery bags for our clients. On the last
          Saturday of each month we distribute the groceries to our clients.
